Welcome aboard.

You’ve just booted into a browser-based operating system — a minimal, interactive space built for curiosity and fun.

What can you do here?

- Launch the Terminal and run simulated commands
- Explore and manage files with the File Manager
- Play a full game of Minesweeper
- View images with the Image Viewer
- Read and edit text in Notepad
- Open external shortcuts like GitHub and LinkedIn
- Move, resize, and stack windows like a real OS

There’s nothing to sign up for or install — just a digital space to explore and make your own.

Enjoy your stay.
